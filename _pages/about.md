Hi there, my name is Don and I am a Master of Mathematical Sciences student at the University of Sydney! My focus in on applied and computational maths, I'm fascinated with how nature works and how we can gain deeper insights into our world by mathematical modelling and performing simulations. I'm working through my master's thesis, which is on using Random Feature Maps (RFMs) to forecast chaotic dynamical systems. RFMs are a cheap and efficient way to set internal weights without the need of extensive computation (e.g. backpropagation). My goal provide a simple and efficient framework for future practioners with a tool for cheaply implements RFMs in systems where chaos is fundamental part such as weather forecasting and fluid dynamics.
